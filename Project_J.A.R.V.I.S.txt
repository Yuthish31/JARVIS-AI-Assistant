🔜 Next Steps for Your J.A.R.V.I.S AI Assistant
Would you like me to now:

1] 🗂️ Set up a full folder structure for your assistant (including voice control, facial login, emotion detection, file system module)?

2] 🧠 Provide starter code for all modules?

3] 🔘 Create a command-based main dashboard (text or voice input)?

4] 🧪 Include test files and a README to run the full system?
